      "I didn't build an international career by accident. I treated it as a project.",
      'In 2018 I started at a startup doing automation on legacy systems. In 2019, at Bosch, I had my first real exposure to global teams and daily English communication. I had always studied English, but for a long time I held myself back thinking I wasn\'t technical enough yet for roles abroad.',
      'The turning point came in 2023, at Doctoralia, when I moved out on my own and realized firsthand how the CLT employment model and its deductions distort salary perception. That\'s when I switched to working as an independent contractor and set my sights on the international market.',
      'The first major opportunity came with Yum Brands (Pizza Hut), and from there, interviews and offers started becoming consistent.',
      'Today I work at People Inc, the largest digital and print publisher in the Americas, with over 40 iconic brands. After being recognized as a top performer in my first year, I visited my team in New York with everything covered.',
